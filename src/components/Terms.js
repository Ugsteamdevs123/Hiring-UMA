                            In instances where a project has not yet commenced, we will provide a complete refund. For each application programming project, an agreement is prepared. If no agreement has been established and/or there is no reference to Terms of Use, the subsequent delivery policy will be implemented:
                            <br></br>
                            <br></br>
                            GRR will consider issuing a partial refund at the discretion of the service provider if the project fails to reach completion as outlined in the delivery policy and contract. The percentage of the project accomplished will be determined by GRR, with the remaining portion handled according to the project's predefined scope.
                        </p>

                            In the event of a delay in commencing the project by any designated resource/staff member (such as a programmer, designer, content writer, SEO expert, or any other staff), GRR will provide a complete refund.
                            <br></br>
                            <br></br>
                            If the client opts to cancel the project at any stage, we will offer a refund proportionate to the work completed.

                            <br></br>
                            We do not provide refunds for days worked. Should the client find any aspect of the work unsatisfactory, they are required to promptly inform our Project Manager and request discounts for any incomplete work. Negotiations regarding such matters will not be entertained at a later time.

                            Prompt Client Communication: While the Terms of Use do not bind GRR, timely provision of information by the client is imperative for the successful project completion. GRR bears no responsibility for project delays or failures resulting from inadequate or delayed communication from the client.
                            <br></br>

                            Information Completeness Provided by the Client: GRR is not obligated to honor delivery or refund commitments if the client does not furnish comprehensive project information/scope during the project initiation phase.
